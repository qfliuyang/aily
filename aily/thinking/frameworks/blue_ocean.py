"""Blue Ocean Strategy framework analyzer (Kim & Mauborgne, 2005).

Create uncontested market space (blue ocean) instead of competing
in existing markets (red ocean). Focus on Value Innovation:
simultaneous differentiation AND low cost.

Key Tools:
- Four Actions Framework: Eliminate, Reduce, Raise, Create
- Strategy Canvas: Visualize value curves
- Six Paths Framework: Cross industry, strategic groups, etc.
