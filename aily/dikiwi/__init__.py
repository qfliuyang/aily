"""DIKIWI - Event-driven knowledge pipeline with institutional review.

Active runtime:
- Event-driven stage coordination
- Institutional review gates (门下省 Menxia, CVO)
- Stage agents used by `DikiwiMind`

Experimental packages still shipped in-tree:
- `aily.dikiwi.skills`
- `aily.dikiwi.memorials`

Those experimental packages are available for tests and future work, but they
are not part of the active production path described in the current docs.

Usage:
    from aily.dikiwi import DikiwiOrchestrator, PipelineConfig

    orchestrator = DikiwiOrchestrator(llm_client, graph_db)
    pipeline = await orchestrator.start_pipeline(content_id, source)
